 <p class='dividerTitle'> How to Change Your Mind</p>
<p>

As we continue to change, age and grow our attitudes and beliefs change and develop. Sometimes this happens naturally, almost unnoticed, other times we choose to bring about a conscious change as we discover our old belief system is limiting or even harming us (or even others) in some way. This process of deliberately changing our minds about something should only be done for our health, growth and well being. It has supported me in resolving my feelings around the past or – recently – changing my mindset around spending an extended period of time completely alone. It is not intended to be used in situations where harm is actively occurring.
</p>
<p>
If you are living with domestic violence, or abuse of any kind, or are forced or required to act against your own wishes and needs, this process is not the appropriate action. It is the situation that needs to change, or you need to be able to remove yourself from the situation. Please reach out to close friends and family, or local or professional services for support and help.

<h2>
How to Change Your Mind</h2>
<ol>
<li>Select a situation that you would like to have a different mental and emotional relationship to, where you feel it is your own attitude or belief or mindset that is creating your discomfort.
For example, after my marriage broke up I was stuck, since I had always maintained I didn’t believe in divorce. Nonetheless, I was separated and didn’t really wish to remain married under those circumstances. After a year I asked myself, what if I believed divorce was possible? Changing my mind about this allowed me to move forward and create change (and get a divorce).

</li>
<li>Get really clear on what you’d like to change. Perhaps some time journaling, meditating, free writing, or talking with a friend or counsellor will assist with this clarity. Preferably get to the point where you can express it in a short sentence, such as: I’ll be depressed if I’m not in a relationship.
</li>
<li>In your mind, aloud, or on a piece of paper, list some alternatives to that belief – not necessarily alternatives you can imagine yourself embracing, just logical alternatives. For the above example, some alternatives might be: I’ll discover how to be in deep relationship with myself, or: I could choose to take a year off from relationships, or: If I’m not in a relationship I’ll have lots of time to be with the friends and family I love the most.
</li>
<li>Spend some moments breathing and feeling into each one of the alternatives you’ve listed. Notice your body sensations, your emotions and your attitudes in response to each one. Now do this for your original sentence.
              Imagine yourself in six months, if you followed the attitude of the original sentence. Breathe and feel into that possibility.
              Now for each one of the alternatives imagine yourself in six months. Breathe and feel into each one.
</li>
<li>Make a choice based on your responses as to which mindset you would prefer to live with. Making this choice requires ignoring all of your usual inner voices, such as those telling you that this can’t be changed, you don’t know how to make this change, or this is unrealistic, impossible, or not who you are.
</li>
<li>Once you have made your choice, commit to it.
You may like to create a ritual around this new mindset. You might like to write in your journal, about its implications and the actions you’ll need to take, to support this change. Each time the thought or feeling of your original mindset arises, replace it gently with your updated mindset. Continue to take actions to support your new mindset on this issue.
</li>
 </ol>
