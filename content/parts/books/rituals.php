    <!-- Create a deeper experience of the Wheel of the Year for yourself and your community. In <span class='book'>Rituals of Celebration</span>, author Jane Meredith provides lyrical accounts of the most memorable rituals she's organized, as well as how-to instructions for creating them. Inspired by Pagan, Druid, and Goddess traditions, the rituals are crafted to help us honor the changing seasons and to mark the important milestones of our personal journeys in a way that is relevant to contemporary life.

    Along with the rituals, you will discover craft projects that go hand-in-hand with each festival―perfect ideas for artistic expression whether you are practicing alone, with a group, or celebrating with children. With additional instructions for building an altar and other basic tasks, this guide includes everything you need to create celebrations that will resonate deeply within you, your family, and your life. -->
