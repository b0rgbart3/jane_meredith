Aphrodite's Magic is a journey into seven aspects of women's sexuality. Enter the Temple of Aphrodite, Goddess of Love and explore the layers of your most private, feminine self. This book will guide you to resolve and heal past trauma, grief and abuse so your sexuality is set free from the past. You will be inspired to honor and celebrate your unique embodiment of the feminine and allow the magic of the Goddess to enter your body with every breath you take. Visualizations and rituals are included to support each step of your journey. Rediscovering seven strands of your sexuality, dancing, journaling and creative processes lead the reader to weave a spell that culminates in a powerful affirmation of self-honoring and sexual embodiment. You can also create your own magical girdle, like the one worn by Aphrodite herself. Aphrodite's Magic will release you from the past and inspire your sexual and spiritual self for the future.</p>
